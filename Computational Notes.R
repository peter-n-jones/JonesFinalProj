## Research Question

# Does level of press freedom have a differential impact on the success of self-determination movements
# relative to the year at which their country widely adopted internet usage?

# In other words, might the potential for internet usage to aid self-determination movement success
# be less salient under central governments that suppress their media/civil society spheres?
