## Project thoughts

For my final project I am interested in diving into the motivations that underpin official recognition by UN member states of separatist regions within sovereign territory. The decision to recognize a fledgling state is rife with political motivations that often have little to do with the relevant separatist region itself; the central government of Spain, for example, derives its nonrecognition of Kosovo (from Serbia) from its own internal problems negotiating with Catalonia. I want to know what factors make a separatist region more likely to be broadly recognized, and, conversely, what factors make it less likely to achieve widespread international recognition.
